Packed Circle Diagram
=================
## Overview
Interactive (click and zoom) visualisation of items into sizes based on leaf story plan, leaf story count or refined estimates. Dive into the item to see it's children. Items have borders coloured according to the "Emphasise on" selector, currently set to either highlight unsized items or to show items with dependencies. If you choose dependencies then the items with predecessors have red borders, if none, then those with successors have yellow borders.

Use shift-Click on item to see dependency popup

When you have clicked on an item to make it the thing of focus, click on it again to get the big status box to come up (CFD diagram, children, etc, etc.)

The app will also try to respect the timebox scope if you have it enabled for the page.
